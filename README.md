KF-GO virtual reality game for Cystic Fibrosis patients as part of TUBITAK project 321S297. Although there is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis, patients must get physiotherapy sessions in order to improve their general quality of life, relieve illness symptoms, and increase their life expectancy. In the form of a virtual reality game, KF-GO provides a gamified version of these physiotherapy sessions.
